# Audio-Data-Processing-and-Analysis-using-RNN
This repository contains code and Jupyter Notebook files for various audio data processing and analysis tasks. 

## File 1: Spectrogram Generation
- Converts audio files to spectrogram images.
- Handles the conversion, saving, and skipping of existing spectrogram images.
- Utilizes libraries such as Librosa and Matplotlib.

## File 2: Audio Cleaning
- Cleans audio files using noise reduction techniques.
- Saves the cleaned audio files in a designated folder.
- Utilizes libraries such as Librosa and Noisereduce.

## File 3: Audio Classification with RNN
- Implements an audio classification model using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
- Uses TensorFlow and Keras for model creation and training.
- Evaluates the model's performance with classification reports, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves.

## Dependencies

The code relies on various Python libraries, including but not limited to:
- Librosa for audio processing.
- TensorFlow and Keras for machine learning and deep learning.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- Scikit-learn for evaluation metrics.

## Usage

Each Jupyter Notebook file contains detailed explanations and code for the respective tasks. You can follow the instructions in each notebook to perform audio data processing and analysis tasks.


Feel free to modify the code and use it for your audio data analysis projects. If you find this code useful, consider citing the libraries and resources used in your work.
